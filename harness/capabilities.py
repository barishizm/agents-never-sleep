"""Capability detection + graceful-degradation reporting for cross-platform enforcement.

Best-effort enforcement means each platform enforces what its hook system allows; the rest falls back
to the SKILL.md prose contract. This module makes that status EXPLICIT so a missing guarantee is never
silent: it owns the per-platform capability matrix and produces blind-spot notes for the degraded
guarantees, which the driver/report surface as startup notes + morning-report BLIND SPOTs.

The matrix is researched fact (see references/cross-platform-enforcement-design.md), not a guess.

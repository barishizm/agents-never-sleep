"""Secret redaction — scrub credentials from everything the night WRITES OUT.

An unattended run writes to four surfaces that can leak a secret a failing test or a careless log
printed: the morning report, the saved gate artifacts (raw command stdout — the biggest risk), the
JSON the driver emits, and — irreversibly — Paperclip comments on shared infra. This module is the
single chokepoint applied at all four.

DESIGN (deliberate, learned the hard way): match a secret by its VALUE SHAPE, never by a nearby
keyword. This codebase's own legitimate output is saturated with the words a naive scrubber keys on —
"token" (tokonomix), "secret", "Authorization" (the Paperclip client), "security" (a specialist
lens), "password" — and `build_report` runs inside the acceptance tests. A keyword-anchored pattern
would shred report prose and coverage tags (and break the suite). So every pattern below is anchored
to the credential's own structure (a `pcp_` board token, a JWT's three base64 segments, a PEM block,
`scheme://user:pass@host`, a provider key prefix). Notably we do NOT redact bare long hex/base64:
a 40-char hex string is just as likely a git SHA (which the harness commits/reports) as a secret.

Pattern matching is the backstop; the LITERAL-VALUE REGISTRY is the precise half — register the exact
secret strings the process knows (PAPERCLIP_TOKEN from env now; Vault-resolved values in a later
slice) and they are scrubbed verbatim even when they match no pattern. Stdlib-only, deterministic.

"""INT-1825 bug 3 — revert_to must NEVER destroy WIP irrecoverably.

`Git.revert_to` does `git reset --hard` + `git clean -fd`, which obliterates any uncommitted
tracked edit AND any untracked file in the shared working tree (a run-branch does NOT protect the
tree — `reset --hard` resets the tree regardless of branch). During the S2 run this reset reverted
a live working edit = real data loss.

The fix: before the destructive reset, anchor a RECOVERABLE backup commit capturing tracked
modifications *and* untracked files into a durable ref, so a wrong/unexpected revert is always
recoverable from git (reflog/ref) the next morning. A clean tree needs no backup.

Exit 0 = GREEN.

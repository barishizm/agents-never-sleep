"""Integration test: drive the ANS harness with a REAL claude -p session.

Marked @pytest.mark.integration — NOT in the standard suite. Run explicitly:
    pytest -m integration acceptance/test_real_claude.py -v

Requires:
- `claude` CLI available on PATH (Claude Code)
- CLAUDE_UNATTENDED=1 may be set; the test sets --permission-mode acceptEdits

What this proves (the only evidence that counts for HN/enterprise — ticket INT-1965):
- A real Claude Code session can drive next/complete until DRAINED
- The harness's durable state (run-progress.json) reflects done>=2 at the end
- Both tickets land with DONE state (no hallucinated stops, no ASK violations)
- The work was actually COMMITTED: the harness's per-ticket `done:<id>` commits land on
  the dedicated `ans/run-*` branch (git-backed reversibility is real, not simulated)

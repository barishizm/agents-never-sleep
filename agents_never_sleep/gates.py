"""Deterministic gate runner — the quality BACKBONE.

The council insisted gates need a FAIL-TAXONOMY from day one, or "tests as hard-block" silently
turns into "always blocked by repo noise" (flaky/pre-existing/env failures masquerading as
"the ticket failed"). We classify by comparing the gate result on the BASELINE (before the
edit) with the result AFTER the edit:

  baseline GREEN, post RED  -> FAIL_INTRODUCED_BY_DIFF  (hard-block: revert + park/fail)
  baseline RED,   post RED  -> FAIL_PREEXISTING         (downgrade confidence, continue/park)
  timeout / cannot run      -> FAIL_ENV / BLOCKED        (env problem, not the diff)
  both GREEN                -> PASS

Every gate runs with a per-STEP timeout (a heartbeat is blind to a single hung command) and a
NON-INTERACTIVE environment so it can never block waiting on a TTY prompt overnight.

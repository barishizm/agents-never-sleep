"""The unattended ticket loop.

Invariants (the whole point of the system):
  * Never asks the human anything in unattended mode (no input(), no prompts, ASK->PARK).
  * Never stops the run on a single ticket problem — it records an outcome and moves on.
  * Only HALTs the whole run on a genuine no-safety-net / irreversible condition.
  * Every ticket ends in exactly one durable OutcomeState (resume-safe).

Two drivers share ONE set of per-ticket helpers so the proven spine logic is never forked:
  * `Orchestrator.run(tickets)` — the in-process loop (DemoWorker / acceptance demo).
  * `harness.driver.StepDriver` — the agent-as-worker bridge: the AGENT is the worker, so the
    loop is driven one ticket at a time across separate processes/turns. It calls the very same
    `classify_ticket` / `begin_proceed` / `finalize_after_edit` helpers below.

Per-ticket spine: snapshot -> decide -> (implement) -> gate -> classify -> revert-or-commit ->
write outcome -> next.

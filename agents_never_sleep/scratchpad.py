"""Per-ticket revert-surviving scratchpad + do-not-repeat digest (ticket 04).

Two learnings from the external "endless-loop" skill (Mes review 2026-06-15) that ANS did not
yet cover:

  1. A crash mid-ticket reverts the CODE to last-green (correct) but the agent's reasoning /
     design decisions are lost — on resume it re-derives from scratch. A per-ticket
     `<ticket>.notes.md` under the state dir persists that reasoning: it lives under
     `.unattended/`, which is gitignored (never committed) AND in the git wrapper's protect set
     (revert's `git clean` never deletes it, see vcs.py) — so the notes survive a revert while
     the code is correctly rolled back to green. The file is re-injected into the PROCEED payload
     so a resumed/fresh agent CONTINUES its reasoning instead of re-deriving.

  2. A compact "tried/failed -> do not repeat" digest handed to the next (fresh or resumed) agent
     session avoids re-attempting the same dead ends.

Everything here is inert unless `autonomy.scratchpad.enabled` is set (default off): with the flag
off the PROCEED payload is byte-identical to today's.

Redaction: note text and digest fields pass through the SAME shape-anchored redactor
OutcomeStore.write uses, so a credential pasted into the agent's notes never lands on disk or in
the payload.

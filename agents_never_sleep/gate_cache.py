"""Gate-baseline reuse cache — a PURE OPTIMIZATION (INT-2330 area, Q&A item 14).

Running the full gate suite twice per ticket (once as "baseline" at `begin_proceed`, once
"after edit" at finalize) is wasteful when the tree the next ticket's baseline would check is
byte-identical to the tree a just-completed ticket's post-edit gate already proved PASS on: the
same command against the same tree can only give the same answer. So a green `complete` writes a
content-addressed receipt (git tree id + the exact gate command), and the next `begin_proceed`
may reuse it instead of re-running the gate.

On ANY doubt this must fall back to running the gate for real — a wrong reuse would poison the
FAIL_INTRODUCED_BY_DIFF / FAIL_PREEXISTING taxonomy gates.py exists to protect. Concretely:
  * the working tree must be CLEAN (a dirty tree isn't the tree the cache describes)
  * the tree id must match EXACTLY (git rev-parse HEAD^{tree} is content-addressed: any file
    byte anywhere flips it)
  * the gate command must match EXACTLY (a config edit invalidates the cache)
  * the cache file must parse and carry `result: PASS` (anything else — missing, corrupt,
    truncated, a stale non-PASS entry — is treated as a miss, never as a crash)

This module never raises: every function degrades to None / a silent no-op on any IO, subprocess,
or parse failure, exactly like the fail-safe conventions in gates.py and state.py.

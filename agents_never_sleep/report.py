"""Morning report — the local canonical, provider-neutral record of what the night did.

The council's mandate: per-ticket outcome + the WHY + the exact human next-action, severity
ranked, with a LOW-YIELD headline when most work was parked/low-confidence (so "the run
finished" can never be mistaken for "the work got done"). This is the local markdown source of
truth; Paperclip mirroring + push are Slice-2/Phase-2.

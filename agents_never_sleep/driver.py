"""Agent-as-worker bridge: drive the unattended loop ONE ticket per call.

The in-process `Orchestrator.run()` works when a deterministic Worker can be called synchronously
(the acceptance demo). In a real overnight run **the agent IS the worker** — it cannot be called
from inside a Python `for` loop; it reads a ticket, edits files, and re-enters the harness to record
the result. So the loop is inverted: the harness hands the agent exactly one PROCEED ticket, the
agent implements it, then calls back to gate+record, and asks for the next one. PARK/HALT/cap/
breaker decisions stay entirely in Python (the proven spine), so the only thing asked of the
unattended agent is the most reliable thing: "implement the ticket body I handed you, then call
complete." Everything else is structural.

Two structural guarantees live here:
  * SENTINEL OWNERSHIP. The Stop-hook blocks a premature end-of-turn while `.unattended/
    run-incomplete` exists. In the old in-process design `run.py` owned that file; now the loop is
    agent-driven, so the DRIVER owns it: it stays set while any non-terminal ticket remains and is
    cleared ONLY when the backlog is genuinely drained / halted / low-yield-tripped. "Never stop at
    2am" is therefore enforced by the file, not by the agent's diligence to keep calling.
  * RESUME-SAFE PROGRESS. Each `next`/`complete` is a fresh process, so breaker accounting is
    recomputed from the durable store every call (not held in memory), and a crash between `next`
    and `complete` is recovered on the next `next`: the partial edits are reverted to the pending
    snapshot and the ticket is re-scheduled under its attempt cap.

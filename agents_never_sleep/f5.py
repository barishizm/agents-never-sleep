"""F5 — consensus-assisted PARK resolution (build-narrow). PURE core; no network, no live loop.

The crux (architect + 3-vendor review, 2026-06-10): ANS exists to PARK rather than gamble. A
consensus that confidently hallucinates an "unblock" would convert a safe PARK into a bad PROCEED —
the exact failure ANS prevents. So F5 is defensible ONLY as a downgrade-only, evidence-gated,
one-shot, narrowly-eligible amplifier — strip any of those four and it becomes that failure.

This module is the deterministic half (mirrors the decide.py / council.py split): it decides
ELIGIBILITY and INTERPRETS the verdict. The actual consensus call is made by the agent via the
tokonomix MCP (the harness can't call LLMs) — the agent reports a structured `F5Verdict` back, and
`interpret_verdict` applies the hard, deterministic downgrade-only gate. The DECISION stays
deterministic even though the evidence-gathering is a model call.

Eligibility is intentionally NARROW: F5 always touches the `requirement_meaning` PARK branch of
decide.classify() (FILE-scoped, foundational=False, reversible), and ALSO any hard-PARK category a
project/ticket has explicitly opted into via `consensus_assisted_categories` — once per ticket
lifetime either way. For hard categories the consensus is asked a grounded SOUNDNESS question (not
disambiguation), a found defect is a deterministic PARK veto (interpret_soundness_verdict), and any
resolution is forced to DONE_LOW_CONFIDENCE + daylight review. NEVER credentials, dependencies, or
HALT — those are facts/authority, not interpretation, and no number of correlated models can supply
them.

    safety net exists, and F5 has not already been attempted on this ticket (one call per lifetime
    — kills park-thrash on resume).

    `consensus_assisted_categories` is the EFFECTIVE set already resolved by the caller (project
    default ± ticket override — see consensus_scope.effective_categories). This function does NOT
    read config or re-classify: it only checks membership, so the same set can be snapshotted into
    the durable offer record and re-checked verbatim at resolve time (anti-TOCTOU). The `()` default
    is a fail-closed safety net (empty/absent set = no hard categories opted in = today's behavior);
    real call sites still pass the effective set explicitly.
